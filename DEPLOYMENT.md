# CodeForge IDE - Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide covers deploying your complete cloud IDE platform to Render, using GitHub as the only storage backend (no database required).

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Render account (free tier available)

## Setup GitHub Storage
1. Create a new (private) GitHub repository to store your app data (e.g., `codeforge-data`).
2. Generate a GitHub personal access token with repo access.
3. Note your GitHub username and the repository name.

## Environment Variables
Set the following environment variables in Render:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Your GitHub personal access token
- `GITHUB_USERNAME`: Your GitHub username
- `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`: The name of your data repository

## Deploy to Render
1. Connect your project repository to Render.
2. Set the environment variables above in the Render dashboard.
3. Deploy the app. Render will build and start the server.
4. All user, project, and file data will be stored in your GitHub data repository.

## Notes
- No database or Supabase setup is required.
- All persistent data is managed as JSON files in your GitHub repository.
- For local development, you can use the same environment variables or fall back to in-memory storage.

## Features Available After Deployment

Your deployed IDE includes all the features of Replit and GitHub Codespaces:

### Core IDE Features
- **Monaco Code Editor** with syntax highlighting for 20+ languages
- **File Explorer** with create, edit, delete, and rename operations
- **Multi-tab Editor** with unsaved changes tracking
- **Real-time Terminal** with command execution simulation
- **Project Templates** (Node.js, React, Vue.js, Python, etc.)

### Collaboration Features
- **Real-time Collaboration** via WebSocket
- **Live Cursor Tracking** showing other users' positions
- **Team Chat** for project communication
- **User Presence** indicators

### Development Tools
- **Git Integration** with status, commit, push, pull operations
- **Code Analysis** and linting
- **Multi-language Support** with auto-detection
- **Responsive Design** works on desktop and mobile

### Advanced Features
- **Batch File Operations** for efficient file management
- **WebSocket-based Real-time Updates**
- **Persistent Project Storage** in GitHub
- **User Management** with authentication ready
- **Extensible Architecture** for adding new features

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check all dependencies are in package.json
   - Verify Node.js version compatibility
   - Review build logs in Render dashboard

2. **WebSocket Issues**
   - Ensure WebSocket connections are enabled in Render
   - Check for proxy/firewall blocking WebSocket traffic

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Consider upgrading Render plan for more resources
   - Optimize large file operations

### Support Resources
- Render Documentation: https://render.com/docs
- Project Issues: Check your GitHub repository issues

## Scaling Considerations

### For Production Use
1. **Upgrade Plans**: Consider paid plans for better performance
2. **CDN Setup**: Use Cloudflare or similar for static assets
3. **Monitoring**: Set up error tracking and performance monitoring
4. **Backup Strategy**: Regular backups of your GitHub repository

### Security Enhancements
1. **Authentication**: Implement proper user authentication
2. **Authorization**: Add role-based access control
3. **HTTPS**: Ensure all connections use SSL/TLS
4. **Input Validation**: Strengthen server-side validation
5. **Rate Limiting**: Implement API rate limiting

## Conclusion

Your CodeForge IDE is now deployed and ready to use! You have a fully functional cloud IDE platform that rivals Replit and GitHub Codespaces, completely free to host and use.

The platform includes all modern IDE features, real-time collaboration, and is built with scalable architecture for future enhancements.
